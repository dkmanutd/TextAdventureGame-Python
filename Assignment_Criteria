In this assignment, students are tasked with designing a text-based adventure game. This game should utilize the Python essentials covered thus far, including, but not limited to:
~ Strings and String Manipulation
~ User-Defined Functions and Variables
~ User Input and Input Handling
~ Conditional and Nested Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)
~ Loops
~ Controlling for Errors

This assignment will test your Python fundamentals, as well as your creativity. Students are required to submit the following deliverables:
~ A working version of your game in the following format:
      .py script or .ipynb notebook
~ A game map (.pptx format), including the following:
      map of the game, including its intended user flow
      locations of conditional statements
      locations of loops
      defined global variables (if any)
 
The working version of the game should include:
~ An executable script (a script that runs from beginning to end upon execution) that includes:
      a game that can be successfully completed within a maximum of 4 minutes
      â€¦a minimum of:
            3 stages (maximum of 5 stages)
            2 defined variables
            1 loop
            1 nested conditional statement
            1 fail() function (executed whenever a user loses the game)
            A docstring at the beginning of game that:
            Is no more than 150 words
            Introduces the game and its purpose
            Identifies any bugs that are not yet worked out
