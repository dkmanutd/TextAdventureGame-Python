Welcome to Adventure Quest - Treasure of Gringotts! In this game, you will
embark on a dangerous journey through the Woods of Muir, which if you
successfully survive, will lead you to discover the mythical treasure of
Gringotts! There will be three rounds: in the first, you will have to answer a
random question to check whether or not you get a bonus life; in the second, 
you will have to face three obstacles from across several multiverses; and
finally, you need to successfully walk through a minefield for this abundant 
treasure to be yours. God speed!
